# PMT_analysis
Scripts for PMT data analysis (PMTAF complementary)
--------------------------------------------------

These are a collection of PMT analysis scripts, complementary to [**PMTAF**](https://github.com/karbenatek/PMTAF.git), developed by my former colleague Antonín Lindner — who introduced me to PMT analysis and data acquisition.

I'm not confident enough (yet!) to fork and modify PMTAF directly, so I created these small helper scripts to support and simplify the analysis process.

I will not include RAW data due to size and push complications with it.




## Experiments

- **[Intensity_test](./Intensity_test)** – Test of PMT energy in lower intensity  
- **[PMT_comparison](./PMT_comparison)** – Comparison of 2 BC-type PMTs  
- **[PMT_custom_cable_test](./PMT_custom_cable_test)** – Quality test of custom made data cable for PMT socket  
- **[PMT_test_ITEL](./PMT_test_ITEL)** – Analysis of all PMTs using dedicated data taking board - ITEL  
- **[Splitter_test](./Splitter_test)** – Quality test of picosecond pulsing laser light splitter
