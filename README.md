# PMT_analysis
Scripts for PMT data analysis (PMTAF complemetary)
--------------------------------------------------

These are a collection of PMT analysis scripts, complementary to [**PMTAF**]((https://github.com/karbenatek/PMTAF.git)), developed by my former colleague Antonín Lindner — who introduced me to PMT analysis and data acquisition:

I'm not confident enough (yet!) to fork and modify PMTAF directly, so I created these small helper scripts to support and simplify the analysis process.


I will not include RAW data (due to possible size), only analysed .root files.
